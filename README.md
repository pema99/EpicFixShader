## Structure

* *uTinyRipperCore*

   Core library. It's designed as an single module without any third party dependencies.
   
* *uTinyRipperGUI*

   Basic graphic interface application. It has some extra converters, so additionally it export:
   * AudioClip .wav export
   * Texture2D .png export (with Sprites)
   * Shader DirectX blob export
   * References to build-in Engine assets
   
* *uTinyRipperConsole* and *uTinyRipperConsoleNETCore*

   Sample console application which is designed to test Core library functionality.   
   It is command line console application. Drag and drop resource file(s) or/and folder(s) onto .exe to retrive assets. It will automaticly try to find resource dependencies, create 'Ripped' folder and extract all supported assets into created directory.
   As it is a sample application so I'm not going to improve it in any way.
